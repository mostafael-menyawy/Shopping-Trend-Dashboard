# Shopping Trend Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Shopping Trend Analysis Dashboard project aims to analyze shopping data to uncover key trends and insights. The goal is to enhance understanding of sales patterns, customer demographics, and purchasing behaviors. This dashboard features interactive visualizations that facilitate detailed exploration of shopping trends.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved several steps to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data were either filled with appropriate values (e.g., mean, median) or removed if deemed unnecessary.
- **Data Formatting**: Ensured all data was in the correct format (e.g., dates, numeric values).
- **Removing Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for key variables.
- **Visual Analysis**: Created various charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns, including:

  - **Sales Overview**: Significant revenues were generated from clothing, accessories, footwear, and outerwear. The dashboard highlights California, Texas, New York, and Florida as the top sales states.
  - **Customer Insights**: The largest customer age group falls between 21-30 years old, with a predominance of male customers.
  - **Payment Preferences**: PayPal and credit cards are the preferred payment methods.
  - **Top Purchases**: The most popular items include blouses, pants, jewelry, shirts, and dresses.
  - **Size Preferences**: XL sizes are the most purchased category.
  - **Seasonal Spending**: Spending peaks during the summer across all categories.
  - **Subscription Status**: A majority of customers do not have an active subscription.
